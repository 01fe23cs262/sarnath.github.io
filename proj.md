#  **Problem Statement**

# Domain
The problem being addressed in this project is the inefficiency and manual errors that occur in traditional restaurant management. Restaurants often struggle with order tracking, inventory management, and billing, leading to delays, inaccuracies, and poor customer experiences. This project aims to automate these processes through a comprehensive restaurant management system that integrates order management, real-time inventory tracking, and automated billing, improving operational efficiency.

The need for this system was identified from a white paper on modern restaurant management systems, which emphasized the challenges faced by restaurants in managing high-volume operations manually. The paper highlighted how automation can reduce human error, speed up service, and enhance customer satisfaction. Motivated by the need to improve restaurant operations, the project was selected to provide a solution that streamlines daily tasks, allowing restaurant staff to focus on quality service while minimizing errors and inefficiencies.


# Module Description
In this project, the focus is on developing and automating the Order Management and Billing System modules for the restaurant management system.
The Order Management module is designed to streamline the process of taking, tracking, and processing customer orders. It allows waitstaff to input orders into the system, which are then transmitted directly to the kitchen for preparation. This minimizes the chances of manual errors, reduces the time taken for orders to be relayed, and ensures that kitchen staff have real-time access to customer requests. The module also tracks the status of orders, from being received to being served, and provides timely updates to customers.

The Billing System is integrated with the order management module, ensuring that customers are billed accurately and promptly based on their order history. It automates the process of generating bills, applying discounts, and calculating totals, removing the need for manual calculations and minimizing the risk of billing errors. The system also supports various payment methods, providing flexibility for customers.

By focusing on these modules, the project aims to improve operational efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance customer satisfaction by providing faster and more accurate service. These modules are essential for optimizing the overall restaurant management process.


**Key Features:**
Customer Queue: Allows adding and removing customers from a queue.
Reservations: Allows table reservations and releases them when necessary.
Inventory: Manage stock of items.
Food Menu and Billing: Displays the menu, takes customer orders, and generates bills.
Delivery System: Calculates the shortest distance between locations.
Lodging: Manages available rooms and bookings for customers.
The program is designed to be a management system for a restaurant with functionalities for customer management, inventory management, reservations, food menu, and more.

# **Algorithms Used:**
**Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest Path):**

Used in the Delivery System to find the shortest distance between two locations. This algorithm is implemented using a priority queue (min-heap) and works by exploring the closest nodes first. It efficiently finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.

Steps:

Initialize distances to infinity.
Use the priority queue to explore nodes starting from the source.
Update the shortest distance for each adjacent node.
Repeat until all nodes are visited or the destination is found.

void shortestDistance(int source, int destination)
{
    // Dijkstra's algorithm implementation
}

**Depth-First Search (DFS) / Breadth-First Search (BFS) (Graph Traversal):**

Although not directly implemented in the code, these algorithms are commonly used in graph-based systems, such as in the Delivery System, where the graph (locations connected by roads) can be traversed using DFS or BFS for route planning.

**Brute Force search:**

Used in places where specific values need to be found in collections such as reservations, inventory items, and menu items (e.g., checking if a reservation exists for a table or if an item is available in the inventory).
cpp

**Greedy Approach (In the context of room booking):**

The Lodging System uses a simple greedy approach when booking rooms. It books the available room of a particular type and removes it from the set of available rooms.
The selection of a room type is done based on the room type requested, without optimization based on pricing (thus it is a greedy choice, always opting for the first available room).

**Quick Sorting :**

The Set data structure in C++ inherently maintains its elements in sorted order. When rooms are added or released in the Lodging System, they are automatically sorted by their room ID (the first element of the pair). This helps in managing room availability efficiently.

**Priority Que**

If you're calculating the shortest route for a food delivery from the restaurant (source) to a customerâ€™s address (destination), the priority queue helps ensure that you always explore the shortest possible route next, thus optimizing the delivery path.
In summary, the priority queue ensures that the Delivery System always processes the most promising locations (i.e., those with the smallest travel distance) first, making the delivery pathfinding process efficient and optimized for a restaurant delivery system.




### Explanation with Respect to a Restaurant Delivery System

### 1) DELIVERY SYSTEM 

This program uses **Dijkstra's algorithm** to find the shortest delivery route from a restaurant to a customer's location.

#### Key Concepts in the Context of Delivery:
1. **Graph Representation**:  
   - Nodes (vertices) represent delivery locations (e.g., restaurant, intersections, customer locations).
   - Edges represent the roads or paths connecting these locations.
   - Edge weights denote the delivery time, distance, or cost associated with a road.

2. **Shortest Path**:
   - The algorithm determines the quickest route from the restaurant (source node) to the customer's address (destination node), considering all possible roads and traffic conditions.

3. **Steps**:
   - **Initialization**: Assign infinite distance to all locations except the starting point (restaurant), which is initialized with zero distance.
   - **Priority Queue**: The algorithm uses a priority queue to explore the location with the currently shortest known distance.
   - **Relaxation**: For each neighboring location, update its distance if the current path is shorter than the previously known path.
   - **Result**: The algorithm ends when the shortest path to the destination is found.

#### Example Application:
- A restaurant (node `0`) is connected to other delivery points via roads with varying weights (delivery times/distances).
- To find the fastest way to deliver an order to the customer's house (node `26`), the system calculates the shortest path and its distance.

### Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - **Priority Queue Operations**: Each edge is relaxed at most once, and the priority queue has at most \( V \) nodes, where \( V \) is the number of nodes.
   - Using a binary heap for the priority queue, the time complexity is \( O((V + E) \log V) \), where \( E \) is the number of edges.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - **Graph Storage**: \( O(V + E) \) for adjacency lists.
   - **Distance and Predecessor Maps**: \( O(V) \).
   - **Priority Queue**: \( O(V) \).

   Overall, the space complexity is \( O(V + E) \).



### Real-World Implications
- **Efficiency**: The system helps ensure timely deliveries by avoiding congested or slow routes.
- **Scalability**: Works well with many delivery locations and roads, provided the graph is sparse.
- **Customizability**: The weights can adapt to represent real-time traffic or delivery priorities.

### 2) STORING LOCATIONS ALONG WITH THEIR SHORTEST DISTANCES

### Priority Queue Role:

The priority queue stores restaurants (or locations) along with their current shortest distance from your home.
It always gives priority to the closest restaurant, ensuring that you explore the shortest possible paths first.

### Process:

You start by adding your home to the queue with a distance of 0.
The priority queue will first pop out your home (since it has the shortest distance), then check the neighboring locations (restaurants) that you can directly access from your home.
For each restaurant, if a shorter route is found via your current location, the queue is updated with the new distance for that restaurant.
The queue ensures that each next restaurant processed is the one with the smallest distance from the start, so the algorithm always works on the shortest possible routes.

### Final Outcome:

At the end, you'll have the shortest path to each restaurant, with the queue helping you process them in order of increasing distance.

**Time Complexity:**

Insertion: O(log n) 

Extraction: O(log n) 

Peek: O(1) 

Decrease-Key: O(log n) 

**Space Complexity: O(n)**

### 3) MANAGE INVENTORY

**Update Inventory Item:**

This functionality updates the quantity of a specific item in the inventory.
The inventory is stored in a map<string, int>, where the key is the item name (string), and the value is the quantity of the item (integer).

**Algorithm:**

If the item exists in the inventory, the quantity is incremented by the specified value. If the item does not exist, it is added with the new quantity.
This update operation in a map has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of items in the inventory.

**Check Inventory:**

This functionality displays the current items and their quantities in the inventory.
The map container automatically keeps the items sorted by the item name.

**Algorithm:**

The program iterates over all key-value pairs in the map and prints them out.
The time complexity for displaying all items is O(n), where n is the number of items in the inventory.
